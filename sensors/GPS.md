# GPS
The GPS sensor gives position data from satellites. 


## Hardware
I am considering using this module: https://core-electronics.com.au/u-blox-neo-6m-gps-module.html after having also bought a $35 surface-mount chip before realising that this little $16 would do the job just fine anyway :(

## Data formats
GPS data is often conveyed in NMEA standard: https://www.trimble.com/OEM_ReceiverHelp/V4.44/en/NMEA-0183messages_MessageOverview.html
This can be transmitted via UART (aka serial).
