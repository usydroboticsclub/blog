# Engineering 101s
When I started as an engineer stepping into a workshop, I heard lots of words thrown around with no idea what they meant. Here's what I eventually found out:
1. Nut and bolt sizes: Contrary to what you may have been taught by LEGO or any of those construction kit toys as a child, it turns out that you can't use the same diameter nut and bolt for every application.
    - There are metric bolts and Imperial bolts. There are also metric and imperial hex keys / allan keys corresponding to these bolts.
        - The Metric bolt system goes by M#, where # is the diameter of the bolt in mm. For example, M2 means a 2mm bolt, M2.5 means a 2.5mm bolt.
            - Note that the diameter is the TAP HOLE diameter - there's a difference!
    - Bolts can vary in a number of different ways.
        - A bolt has a head (the top bit), which can come in different types: flat head, phillips head, hex head.
        - The bolt has a thread.
    - When using bolts, there are two holes:
        - The tap hole: This is the diameter of a hole which needs to be threaded to fit a bolt through. 
        - The through hole: This is the diameter of a hole which a threaded bolt will comfortably fit through into. This is typically slightly bigger than
