# Robotics FAQ

## How do I get started with USRC?
Well, let's first check that you fit our description.
- You want to build robots, and you want to build robots now.

Does that sound like you? Good. We're on the same page.
To answer your question then, to get started, you need to pick a robot to build. Check out our [robot gallery   ](../gallery)!

## Does [insert thing here] count as a robot?
Robotics is about three key steps: Sense, Control, Act. So ask yourself: Does the behaviour of the device change based on its awareness of the environment or itself? 
If it's not alive, it's probably a robot.
