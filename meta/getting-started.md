# Getting started with USRC
## About you
- It's ok if you don't know how to code or don't know the first thing about robotics, but you just want in. That's why we're here. 
## Terms of engagement
- The answer to "How much time will I need to spend on this every week" is: We will not monitor your commitment, but we will not monitor your commitment. 
- For each of our activities, there is a rough estimate of how much time it will take. It's up to you to set your level of commitment. 
## The main program
1. Join our group. This means, head to [discord, where we hang out.](https://discord.gg/JmpUX7G)
### Semester 1
2. Take our online tutorials (total time 5-10 hours, so half a semester's worth)
    - Learn to use `git`, a version management system that will be useful any time you work on code: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/intro (Estimated time: 1-2hr)
    - Learn `python`, an accessible but powerful programming language: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/python and https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/py_harder (estimated time: 4hr = 2x2hr)
    - Learn `opencv`, a toolkit for working with images and camera feeds: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/intro-to-opencv (estimated time: 2-3hr)
3. Build a mini arduino-bluetooth robot with us. (2-4 hours)

### Semester 2
Welcome to second year! You will have done enough tron to know what you're doing most of the time.
5. Take more online tutorials. 
    - Get familiar with Linux. 
    - Learn `ROS`, the robot operating system with us: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/ROS

-- Gazebo arm robot purely in sim?

-- Making PCB / 3d printing?

-- ROS swarm laser tag? / robot swarm?

-- actual robot arm?

-- reinforcement and machine learning?

-- SLAM system? (Phone AR)

-- drones? aero + IMU + power + minification

3. Build a self-driving car with us. (2-4 hours)
    - The car will be a rechargeable, GPS-controlled car. 
    - Theoretically this can be done in one afternoon, but it might take a bit longer.
    - Reach out on Discord if you want to take part in this.

### Semester 3
4. Build a spiderbot with us. (2-4 hours)
    - If you want, you can try and build your own reverse-kinematic engine as well.
