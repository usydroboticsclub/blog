# USRC: Statement of purpose

## A bit of context
When USRC started in 2017, robotics was in season. There were robotics comps aplenty, like the robot art competition, DRC, NiARC.
In the coming years, however, AI and machine learning became the new big thing. Suddenly, company robotics sponsorships nosedived. NiARC and Robotart both disappeared.

USRC was originally created to help students access robotics competitions, but suddenly there were none.

What's worse, although we were the USYD Robotics club, we weren't the only people offering robotics related things in the university. Indeed, we were competing against:
- SUMO: the Sydney University Mechatronics Organisation, who put themselves in charge of the careers-y side of mechatronics;
- The actual mechatronics degree, which technically taught people how to become robotics engineers, and had the resources to offer most students hands-on robotics experience.

So if we had no competitions to run, and the uni was already providing hands on robotics courses, and there was a huge deluge of robotics related youtube videos out there, what could we do?

## USRC's strengths
That's not to say we didn't have any opportunities at all. To date, USRC does have:
- A sizeable inventory (when we have access to it...), including:
    - Depth-sensing cameras
    - A lot of arduinos, motors and wheels (from our workshops)
- The freedom to choose our approach (Engineers Australia isn't going to wave a stick at us if we don't provide a legitimate mechatronics engineering course on our first try).
- The USRC name. We belong to one of the G5 universities in Australia. That's a huge boost to our marketing :D

## Our purpose
Our original mission of helping USYD students access robotics competitions seems rather hard to reach right now. We do however still seek to help USYD students gain hands-on access to robotics, whether through competitions or otherwise. 

As a club, we also want to cultivate a sense of community.

## How we'll do this
We will help USYD students access robotics by:
- Providing a learning pathway that students can access at their own pace, including providing physical parts or their alternatives, through our blog
- Keep looking for robotics competitions and sponsors to help our students get external robotics accreditations.
