# The USRC blog
Hey there! Welcome to the USRC blog!

You've probably seen lots of blogs before, but you might not really follow them, because who has time to read blogs these days? At USRC, we saw this as a problem, and wanted to change how we run things a little.

The thesis: We want to make a blog that you want to read. Normally, blogs are constructed as linear in time but otherwise difficult to navigate (perhaps with the odd blog tag). Sure, that's how blogs are written, but leaving them that way makes it hard for you as a reader to read about what _you_ want.  

The solution: We'll structure this blog as a file structure. There'll still be a stream if you _want_ to read the blog in a semblance of order, but this base will also serve as reference hub for our members as much as a regularly updated blog.

So please come back. We'll promise to keep things fresh and organised, so you can stay up to date and still find things when you need them.

Happy tronning!
